# List of software to pharmacophore modeling

The following table summarizes the list of software we have found so far to build, and to work
with, pharmacophore models. The table includes these next features for each software:

|   Property | Letters  | When |
|---|---|---|
| Open Source | OS | If the code is available and with open source standards |
| Free |  FR | If the software is free to be used. Or at least there is a non-commercial or academic license |
| Proprietary | PR | If the software is non-free, copyrighted, and runs under commercial licenses |
| Pythonic | PY | The software is open source in Python, or there is an API in Python implemented |
| Multi-structures | MS | If the software provides the possibility to play explicitly with different structures of the same compound or receptor |
| Molecular Dynamics| MD | If the software provides the possibility to build pharmacophoric models running molecular dynamics or from molecular dynamics trajectories|
| Virtual Screening | VS | If the software runs virtual screenings |
| De Novo Design | DN | If the software is oriented to perform *de novo* design |
